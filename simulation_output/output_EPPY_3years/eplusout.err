   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (2) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PROJECT PARTITION of interzone surface BLOCK1:ZONE3_PARTITION_2_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PROJECT PARTITION_REV of adjacent surface BLOCK1:ZONE1_PARTITION_4_0_10000
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 5 window/glass door(s) that may cause inaccurate shadowing due to Solar Distribution.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each window, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 6 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Temperature out of range [-100. to 200.] (PsyPsatFnTemp)
   **   ~~~   **  Routine=CalcPurchAirLoads, During Sizing, Environment=WINTER DESIGN DAY IN LAB_PART1 (O1-O1:31-12), at Simulation time=01/15 24:00 - 24:30
